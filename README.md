**Image Processing App**
**📖 Overview**

The Image Processing App is a powerful yet easy-to-use application built using Python’s renowned libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow (PIL), and SciPy. This project is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for performing various image processing operations, including edge detection, filtering, segmentation, and more.

Whether you are a beginner learning the basics of image processing or an advanced user looking for a quick way to process images, this app offers a wide range of tools to simplify your workflow.

**✨ Features**

Image Analysis
Get Histogram: Visualize the distribution of pixel intensities.
Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale for basic processing.
Edge Detection
Sobel: Apply Sobel operator for edge detection.
Prewitt: Highlight edges using the Prewitt method.
Kirsch: Detect edges with high sensitivity using the Kirsch operator.
Filters
Low-Pass Filters: Smooth images and reduce noise.
High-Pass Filters: Highlight edges and fine details.
Median Filter: Reduce noise while preserving edges.
Difference of Gaussians: Enhance details and textures.
Image Segmentation
Thresholding: Apply binary or adaptive thresholds.
Manual Segmentation: Define and segment regions manually.
Contrast-Based Segmentation: Segment images based on intensity contrast.
Valley and Peak Detection: Identify significant regions in the histogram.
Miscellaneous Operations
Invert Colors: Create negative images.
Add/Subtract Images: Combine or compare images pixel-by-pixel.
Homogeneity Analysis: Compute texture uniformity.

**💻 Technologies Used**
The application is built using:

CustomTkinter: For creating a modern and responsive GUI.
Pillow (PIL): For image loading and manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical computations on image data.
Matplotlib: For visualizing histograms and other graphical results.
SciPy: For advanced filtering and edge-detection algorithms.
